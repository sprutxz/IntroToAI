Hi this is a test

\section*{The Second Task}
The second task involved a multinomial classification problem where we had to determine, on a given dangerous wire diagram, which wire to cut.
To fullfill this purpose, we used a softmax regression model that output a number for the wire to be cut. The right wire to be cut, as stated in the project 3 writeup, would be te 3rd wire to be placed down.\newline
\newline
We numbered the wires as follows:
\begin{quote}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Red
    \item Blue
    \item Yellow
    \item Green
    \end{enumerate}
    \end{quote}
