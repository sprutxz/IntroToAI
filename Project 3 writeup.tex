\section*{The First Task}
Hi this is a test

\section*{The Second Task}
The second task involved a multinomial classification problem where we had to determine, on a given dangerous wire diagram, which wire to cut.
To fullfill this purpose, we used a softmax regression model that output a number for the wire to be cut. The right wire to be cut, as stated in the project 3 writeup, would be te 3rd wire to be placed down.\newline
\newline
We numbered the wires as follows:
\begin{quote}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Red
    \item Blue
    \item Yellow
    \item Green
    \end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

\noindent Input Space:\newline
Output Space:\newline
Model space:\newline
\newline The loss on my model is measured through the categorical cross entropy loss function. 
This loss function is used to measure the error between the predicted output and the actual output. The categorical cross entropy loss function is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    CE = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{i} \log(\hat{y}_{i})
\end{equation}

\noindent Here, $y$ is the actual output and $\hat{y}$ is the predicted output. $N$ is the number of data points we have
